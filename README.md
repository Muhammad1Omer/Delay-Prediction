# Advanced Flight Departure Delay Analysis Project

## Overview
This project addresses the critical challenge of predicting flight departure delays, which significantly impact passenger satisfaction and airline operations. Using historical flight data and weather information, the project identifies patterns affecting delays and develops predictive models to classify and estimate delay durations.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Combines flight and weather datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Derives insightful features such as delay categories, temporal attributes, and weather patterns.
- **Data Analysis**: Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in delays.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Binary classification (on-time vs. delayed).
  - Multi-class classification (categorizing delay durations).
  - Regression analysis (predicting exact delay durations).
- **Model Optimization**: Employs techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for robust predictions.
- **Submission**: Generates predictions formatted for evaluation in Kaggle competitions.

## Project Phases
### Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and standardized time formats.
- Merged flight and weather data based on shared keys (e.g., scheduled date).

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized delay distributions across airports, hours, and airlines.
- Conducted correlation analysis between weather and delay data.

### Feature Engineering
- Created delay categories (short, moderate, long).
- Extracted temporal and weather-based features for better predictive insights.

### Model Development
- Implemented Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes models.
- Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, MAE, and RMSE.

### Optimization and Testing
- Performed grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
- Validated models using k-fold cross-validation.
- Generated predictions for test data and formatted for Kaggle submission.

## Results
### Binary Classification
- **Best accuracy**: 95% (Random Forest).
- High precision and recall for delayed flights.

### Multi-Class Classification
- Effective categorization of delay durations.

### Regression
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 28 minutes.
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: 73 minutes.

## Key Insights
- **Temporal Trends**: Evening hours and weekends exhibit higher delays.
- **Weather Impacts**: Precipitation and wind significantly influence delays.
- **Airline-Specific Observations**: Operational inefficiencies in certain airlines contribute to delays.

## Practical Strategies
- **Operational Efficiency**: Allocate resources during peak hours and adverse weather conditions.
- **Passenger Communication**: Proactively notify passengers of potential delays.
- **Collaborations**: Partner with weather services for real-time updates.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platform**: Kaggle for prediction evaluation
